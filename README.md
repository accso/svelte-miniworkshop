# Svelte Mini Workshop

This repo is part of a small workshop to get started with Svelte. The use case is building a TODO app. Below the folder `src` are tasks 1 to 4 which should be worked on in order as they build on each other. Each task folder contains a `README.md` with the instructions. You can solve all talks writing all code inside `task-1`, or you can solve each task in its corresponding folder. To do that, inside `App.svelte` you need to comment in the correct import and comment out all the others. If you are stuck on a task, you can take a peek into the next task. `final` contains the state of the application after having solved all tasks.
